# Adminer

## What is Adminer?

Adminer (formerly phpMinAdmin) is a full-featured database management tool written in PHP. Conversely to phpMyAdmin, it consist of a single file ready to deploy to the target server. Adminer is available for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MS SQL, Oracle, Firebird, SimpleDB, Elasticsearch and MongoDB.

## How to use this image

### Standalone

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 jjworren/adminer
```

Then you can hit `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in your browser.

### ... via [`docker-compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose) or [`docker stack deploy`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stack_deploy/)

Example `docker-compose.yml` for `adminer`:

```yaml
# Use root/example as user/password credentials

version: '3.1'

services:

  adminer:
    image: jjworren/adminer
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

  db:
    image: mysql:5.6
    restart: always
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
```

Run `docker stack deploy -c stack.yml adminer` (or `docker-compose -f stack.yml up`), wait for it to initialize completely, and visit `http://swarm-ip:8080`, `http://localhost:8080`, or `http://host-ip:8080` (as appropriate).

### Loading plugins

This image bundles all official Adminer plugins. You can find the list of plugins on GitHub: https://github.com/vrana/adminer/tree/master/plugins.

To load plugins you can pass a list of filenames in `ADMINER_PLUGINS`:

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 -e ADMINER_PLUGINS='tables-filter tinymce' jjworren/adminer
```

If a plugin *requires* parameters to work correctly instead of adding the plugin to `ADMINER_PLUGINS`, you need to add a custom file to the container:

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 -e ADMINER_PLUGINS='login-servers' jjworren/adminer
Unable to load plugin file "login-servers", because it has required parameters: servers
Create a file "/var/www/html/plugins-enabled/login-servers.php" with the following contents to load the plugin:

<?php
require_once('plugins/login-servers.php');

/** Set supported servers
    * @param array array($domain) or array($domain => $description) or array($category => array())
    * @param string
    */
return new AdminerLoginServers(
    $servers = ???,
    $driver = 'server'
);
```

To load a custom plugin you can add PHP scripts that return the instance of the plugin object to `/var/www/html/plugins-enabled/`.

### Choosing a design

The image bundles all the designs that are available in the source package of adminer. You can find the list of designs on GitHub: https://github.com/vrana/adminer/tree/master/designs.

To use a bundled design you can pass its name in `ADMINER_DESIGN`:

```console
$ docker run --link some_database:db -p 8080:8080 -e ADMINER_DESIGN='nette' adminer
```

To use a custom design you can add a file called `/var/www/html/adminer.css`.

### Usage with external server

You can specify the default host with the `ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER` environment variable. This is useful if you are connecting to an external server or a docker container named something other than the default `db`.

```console
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER=mysql adminer
```

### Env Variables

Handy for lazy usage in docker compose for development purposes

| Var | Description | example |
| - | - | - |
| ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER | Default server prefilled in login screen | postgres |
| ADMINER_DEFAULT_DRIVER | Default driver preselected in login screen | psql |
| ADMINER_DEFAULT_USERNAME | Default username preffiled in login screen | pguser |
| ADMINER_DEFAULT_PASSWORD | Default password preffiled in login screen | pqpassword |
| ADMINER_DEFAULT_DB | Default db name prefilled in login screen | postgres |

## Supported Drivers

While Adminer supports a wide range of database drivers this image only supports the following out of the box:

-	MySQL
-	PostgreSQL
-	SQLite
-	SimpleDB
-	Elasticsearch

To add support for the other drivers you will need to install the following PHP extensions on top of this image:

-	`pdo_dblib` (MS SQL)
-	`oci8` (Oracle)
-	`interbase` (Firebird)
-	`mongodb` (MongoDB)
